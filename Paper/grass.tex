\begin{abstract}
We show that the threshold flow condition for the spontaneous waving of marine grass arises due to the drag exerted by the vegetation on the flow. 
We show this by developing a self-consistent model of the flow past rigid vegetation. 
Linear stability analysis of the steady flow resulting from this model naturally leads to the threshold condition, and explains its mechanistic origin. 
Asymptotic analysis of the model for dense grass reveals two unstable modes. 
One of these modes shares many common features with the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, but is demonstrated to be different from it. 
The predictions of the model for threshold condition and the resulting dominant frequency of waving agree with laboratory observations.

%\section{Introduction}
Sea grasses exhibit a rich set of dynamical behavier due to their
 collective interaction with both steady and oscillatory flows. 
%interaction with the flow of water and can considerably affect surrounding hydrodynamic conditions.
%Resulting 
The resulting changes in hydrodynamic conditions can influence number of environmental processes such as transport of sediments, contaminants, dissolved oxygen, plant growth, and biomass production \cite{Fonseca87,Grizzle96,Nepf99,Nepf2012}.
The simplet response of these flexible grass canopies 
%Flexible grass canopies respond 
to steady currents 
%in the form of 
is the formation of coherent large amplitude oscillations, known as \monami \cite{AckermanOkubo93}. 
%Such motion is considered to play a central role in the recruitment 
%of microscopic marine organisms, such as blue mussel larvae\cite{Grizzle96}.
%The hydrodynamic mechanism underlying \monami is the focus of this paper. 
In this letter we provide a hydrodynamic mechanism for the onset of these coherent oscillations.

%Existing 
Current explanations of \monami invoke the existence of a shear layer near the top of the canopy \cite{Ghisal02,Raupach96} and its instability 
%due to different amounts of drag experienced by fluid in and above the canopy. 
%This shear layer is interpreted to become unstable to coherent vortices 
through a mechanism similar to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. This is thought to lead to coherent eddies over the sea grass canopy which then drives 
%Influence of these coherent eddies over sea grasses is manifested in their 
large amplitude synchronous oscillations.

 and it's approximation with $U_0=7.28$ cm/s and $\delta = 5.02$ cm with our model. The canopy extends upto $y=h_g$ in the water column of depth $2H$. 
The steady velocity profile can be decomposed into three regions, (i) A parabolic profile in the unvegetated region, (ii) a uniform profile deep within the grass bed, and (iii) a boundary layer of thickness $\delta$ near the canopy top. 
The dependence of the boundary layer thickness (estimated numerically as $|U/U_y|$ at $y=\hg$) on the vegetation density parameter $\Rey \Ndg$ is shown in the inset.}
\label{basicflow}
\end{figure}

While the shear layer model appears to predict the frequency of \monami consistent with experimental observations, several aspect of existing theory remain unsatisfactory. 
(i) While the free shear layer is established due to the vegetation drag, linear stability analysis\cite{Raupach96} does not account for this, rendering this explanation inconsistent. 
(ii) Classical free shear flow is known to be unstable for all Reynolds number\cite{drazin}, whereas observations in the lab\cite{Ghisal02} and the field\cite{Grizzle96} indicate the existence of a threshold 
flow speed below which \monami is not observed. 
(iii)The thickness of the free shear layer, defined as the momentum thickness of the boundary layer near the grass tip, is in many cases comparable to the unvegetated layer thickness,
and therefore inconsistent with the assumptions of the free shear layer instability. 
% These drawbacks of existing theory suggest that flow through vegetation requires further investigation for better understanding of the phenomenon.

Here we present a self-consistent mathematical model that account correctly for these effects while also explaining 
%exhibiting a rich behavior, which is not only consistent within itself, but also with 
lab experiments and field observations.
%Using this model, the synchronous waving may be understood to be arising from the linear hydrodynamic instability of a uniform flow over the grass bed, such that the principal role of the vegetation is to exert a drag on the flow. 
%A threshold flow speed arises naturally for the onset of the instability; this threshold condition and the resulting waving frequency compares well with experimental observations.
%The vegetation drag introduces a damping mechanism in the flow, in addition to the viscous damping, and overcoming this damping is the primary consideration that sets the threshold flow.
%We deduce this numerically and through an asymptotic scaling analysis in the limit of dense grass.
\newline
The drag exerted by the grass bed on the flow is central to the hypothesized mechanism\cite{Ghisal02} of the instability underlying \monami because it realizes the shear layer structure of the flow. 
The flexibility of the grass blades, on the other hand, serves merely aid in visualizing the flow structure resulting from the instability\cite{Nepf2012}. 
It has been demonstrated that the instability and the resulting flow structures are present even when the grass blades are replaced with rigid dowels\cite{Ghisal02}. 
Therefore, for simplicity, 
%mathematical model for the linear instability, 
we consider the grass bed to form a rigid structure that exchanges momentum with the surrounding fluid but does not deform. 
Indeed, a more detailed calculation undertaken for terrestrial grass demonstrated\cite{Delangre06} that when the timescale of the instability is well-separated from the period of natural oscillations of the grass bed, 
the flow instability is similar to the instability of a shear layer.

also included in the top panel. Inset compares experimental observations

\label{Re_vs_delta}
\end{figure}
We use a mean field model for the coupling between the flow and the canopy. 
The force exerted by the grass is approximated via a continuous body force $\mathbf{f}=-N_g\mathbf{f_d}$,  
where $\mathbf{f_{d}}$ is drag force per unit length of the grass blade, $N_g$ the grass number density per unit area. In the canopy the equations of continuity \& momentum balance can be written as 
%in the fluid momentum balance\cite{Vivoni98,Nepf99,Ghisal02,Delangre04,Delangre06} as
\begin{equation}
\quad \grad\cdot\bu = 0,\hspace{3mm} \rho \left(\bu_{t}+\bu.\grad\bu \right) = -\grad P+\mu\grad^{2}\bu +\mathbf{f}+\rho\mathbf{g}
\label{navier-stokes}
\end{equation}
%where $\mathbf{f_{d}}$ is drag force per unit length of the grass blade, $N_g$ the grass number density per unit area, 
where $\rho$ the fluid density, $\mathbf{u}$ the velocity, 
$P$ the pressure, $\mu$ the turbulent viscosity and $\mathbf{g}$ the acceleration due to gravity. 
The Reynolds number of the flow based on the scale of a grass blade is expected to be O($10^2$-$10^3$), and hence the drag force is dominated by pressure and modeled as 
$\mathbf{f_{d}}=C_N \rho u_{N}^{2}d\bn + C_{T}\rho u_{T}^{2}d\bt$ \shreyas{citation needed} 
where $d$ is average width of grass blade $C_{N}$ and $C_{T}$ are the normal and tangential drag coefficients respectively; $u_{T}$, $u_{N}$ are velocity components along and
normal to grass while $\bt,\bn$ being unit vector along and normal to grass. 
We expect $C_T \ll C_N$ and take $C_T=0$ for rest of analysis. 
In the field, both $C_N$ and $N_g$ vary with distance from the bottom but we do not expect these variation to be central to the mechanism and therefore take $C_N$ and $N_g$ to be constants. 
Based on previous experiments\cite{Vivoni98}, we take $C_N \approx 1$.

To understand the onset of, we first calculate the steady flow $\bu = U(y)\boldsymbol{\hat{x}}$ as a solution of \eqref{navier-stokes}, and examine its linear stability. 
Such a steady state flow driven by constant pressure gradient satisfies 
\begin{equation}
 -{dP}/{dx}+\mu U''(y) +S(y) \rho C_N d N_gU^2=0
\end{equation}
where $S(y)=1$ in the vegetated layer $0<y<\hg$ and $S(y)=0$ in the unvegetated layer $\hg< y< 2H$. In the limit of large grass density, shear stress exerted by the bottom surface is estimated to be negligible in comparison with the drag and hence the bottom surface ($y=0$) is approximated by zero shear.   
%The flow in the laboratory experiments is better approximated by zero shear at the bottom ($y=0$) and top ($y=2H$) of the fluid layer, 
%as can be seen from the comparison between sample solutions and mean flow observed in laboratory experiment shown in Figure \ref{basicflow}. 
A comparison of laboratory mean profile with the steady flow profile is shown in figure \ref{basicflow}.
Flow within grass has approximately constant velocity $U_g \sim \sqrt{\frac{dP/dx}{\rho C_N dN_g}}$ arising from the balance between drag and with pressure gradient. Flow outside has a simple parabolic velocity profile due to the balance between viscous forces and the pressure gradient. 
Continuity of flow speed and shear stresses at canopy top gives rise to a boundary layer 
%in the flow profile 
near the tip of the grass. 

This boundary layer near the canopy top results from purely local dynamics independent of the influence of the boundaries, and we identify it as a free shear layer\cite{Ghisal02} in the previous explanation of \monami. 
In our model shear layer thickness can be estimated from the the balance between viscous forces and drag in the boundary layer near canopy top along with the continuity of shear stress at the grass tip. This leads to a shear layer thickness $\delta = (\Rey\Ndg)^{-1/3} H$, where $\Ndg = \left(C_N d H N_g\right)$ is the vegetation frontal area per bed area, $\Rey=\rho U_0 H/\mu$ is the Reynolds number of the flow, and $U_0 = {(dP/dx)~H^2}/{\mu}$ is scale for velocity. 
This dependence of the boundary layer thickness on the grass density $N_g$, shown in Figure \ref{basicflow}, gives us a way to systematically control it and investigate its effect on the instability mechanism.
The asymptotic regime of a thin boundary layer is expected to hold for $\Rey \Ndg \gtrsim 100$; minor departures from this scaling can be seen in the inset of figure \ref{basicflow}.

Considering small perturbations $u, v, p$ about the base profile $U$ and $P$ respectively, equation \eqref{navier-stokes} expanded to linear order in the perturbations yields
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\rho(u_t+U u_x+vU_y) &= -p_x+ {\mu}\nabla^2u-2S\rho C_{N}dN_{g}Uu, \\
\rho(v_t+ Uv_x) &= -p_y+ {\mu}\nabla^2v, \hspace{0.3cm} \nabla\cdot\bu=0.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
These equations can be non-dimensionalized using half channel height $H$, velocity $U_0$, and the associated advection time $H/U_0$. 
We are left with three non-dimensional parameters in the model, viz. $\Rey$, $\Ndg$, and the submergence ratio of the grass $h_g/H$. 
We also use $\delta/H$ in lieu of $\Ndg$ to parametrize the grass density and help elucidate the mechanism of the instability. 
With these scaling, and using a stream function $\psi$ with $u = \psi_{y}, v= -\psi_x$ to satisfy mass balance, we seek a wave solution of 
the form $\left(u,v,\psi \right)= \left(\hat u, \hat v, \hat\phi \right)e^{ikx+\sigma t}$ to  obtain a modified Orr-Sommerfield equation. 
The eigenvalue $\sigma$ for a given $k$ provides growth rate and frequency associated with a perturbation of wavelength $2\pi/k$ through the solution of
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\left(D^2 -k^{2} \right)^2\phi &= \Rey \left[ \left({\sigma}+ikU\right) \left(D^2-k^2\right) -ikU_{yy}\right]\phi \\
&+D\left(2R \Ndg S U D \phi\right),
\label{Orr-somerfield}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $D=d/dy$, and subject to the boundary conditions $D\phi = D^2\phi = 0$ at $y=0$ and $y=2$. 

Comparison of frequency (Im$(\sigma)$) of the fastest growing mode with that of experimental observations of frequencies in
the lab scale experiments, for cases where the vegetation was sufficiently dense to be modeled by a continuum drag field, 
is shown in Figure \ref{Re_vs_delta}. 
The observed frequencies are associated with the peaks in velocity spectra, frequency of $\monami$ and frequency of 
vortex passage \cite{Ghisal02}, and compare well with the predicted frequencies. 

A threshold in $\Rey$ of O(100), above which the flow is unstable (Re($\sigma$)$>$0), naturally emerges from the 
solution of \eqref{Orr-somerfield}. 
The dependence of this critical $\Rey$, and the corresponding fastest growing wavenumber $k$, on $\delta/H$ and $\hg/H$ is shown 
in figure \ref{Re_vs_delta}, and is found to compare well with experimental observations\cite{Ghisal02}.
The threshold Reynolds number increases with the grass density, indicating a competition between the 
destabilizing shear in the flow, and the stabilizing effect of damping due to vegetation drag.
Previous linear stability calculations undertaken for terrestrial grass do not exhibit a threshold flow condition 
either due to the exclusion of the vegetation drag in their model\cite{Raupach96}, or because of the over-simplifying 
assumptions such as a tanh- or piece-wise linear mean velocity profile\cite{Raupach96,Delangre06}.
Regardless of the assumptions, the introduction of vegetation drag is observed to damp the linear modes\cite{Delangre06}.

To better understand the mechanism of waving and the origin of the threshold, we consider the behavior of the instability as a function of the vegetation drag.
The fastest growing wavenumber first increases proportional to $H/\delta$, but at a critical grass density discontinuously jumps and remains $O(1)$ (see figure \ref{Re_vs_delta}). 
To aid in explaining the behavior, we show heat maps of Re$(\sigma)$ as a function of $\Rey$ and $k$, for different $\hg/H$ and $\Ndg$ in figure \ref{K_Re_sigma_set3}. 
The lowest $\Rey$ on the neutral curve sets the threshold. 
We observe that as $\Ndg$ increases, the unstable region splits into two. We refer to the unstable region with the higher $k$ as ``Mode 1'', and the one with the lower $k$ as ``Mode 2''. 
The unstable region for Mode 1, depending on $\hg/H$ either recedes to higher $\Rey$ or shrinks to zero size, as the grass density increases, causing the discontinuity in the most unstable mode.

The distinct asymptotic behavior of the two modes as $\Ndg \gg 1$ allows us to understand the mechanism of the instability. 
Mode 2 has a threshold $\Rey \sim ({\delta}/{H})^{-3/2}$ (or $\Rey \propto \Ndg$) for $k\sim O(1)$, shown in figure \ref{Re_vs_delta}, which can be understood by an asymptotic scaling analysis of \eqref{Orr-somerfield} by assuming $\Rey \gg 1$ but $\Rey/\Ndg \sim O(1)$,.
Note that for large $\Ndg$, the non-dimensional steady flow velocity inside the grass is $U_g \sim (\Rey \Ndg)^{-1/2}$. 
This estimate simplifies \eqref{Orr-somerfield} within the grass to $\sigma\left(D^2-k^2\right)\phi = -2{(\Ndg/\Rey)^{1/2}}D^2\phi$, while in the unvegetated region it simplifies to the Rayleigh equation $ \left(\sigma+ikU\right) \left(D^2-k^2\right)\phi =  ikU_{yy}\phi$. 
This analysis predicts that the mode shape would converge in this limit, in agreement with our numerical results for Mode 2 shown in figure \ref{Asymptotic_mode}. 

We interpret this as the instability of an inviscid flow, with the vegetation modeled by a continuum drag field, and for which the boundary layer near the grass tip plays no role. The only remaining parameter $\Rey/\Ndg$ 
sets the threshold, leading to the asymptotic behavior $\Rey \propto \Ndg$ (or $\Rey \sim ({\delta}/{H})^{-3/2}$).


\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[]{Asymptotic_noshear}
\caption{Plot of mode shape $|\phi|$ for different shear layer thickness in limit of small shear layer thickness for representative values of grass density. 
Mode 1 is shown in solid and Mode 2 is shown in dashed. The parameters Mode 2 shapes are chosen such that $\Rey \gg 1$, $\Ndg \gg 1$ (specified in terms of $\delta/H$) but $\Rey/\Ndg = O(1)$. 
The mode shapes approach each other for these small values of $\delta/H$ indicating that the large grass density asymptote is reached. Mode 1 shapes appear self-similar in shape as $\delta\to 0$, 
and are compared to each other on a rescaled coordinate in the inset. 
Inset shows $|\phi|$ for Mode 1 as a function of $(y-\hg)/\delta$. The modes approach a universal shape, indicating that an asymptotic limit has been reached. 
The limit is not yet reached for the case $\delta/H = 0.005$ due to the influence of bottom boundary; the grass height in this case is comparable to the boundary layer thickness.}
\label{Asymptotic_mode}
\end{figure}

On the other hand, Mode 1 asymptotically localizes to the boundary layer near the grass tip, and exhibits a different asymptotic behavior with $k \sim O(H/\delta)$, and $\Rey \sim (H/\delta)$ (or $\Rey \propto {\Ndg}^{1/2}$) at the threshold. 

This limit can be understood through asymptotically estimating the sizes of the terms in \eqref{Orr-somerfield} using $D\sim \delta^{-1}$, $\sigma \sim \delta^{-1}$, and $U\sim \delta$; the magnitude of the advection term is $\Rey/\delta^3 \sim \Rey^2 \Ndg $, and the viscous term (or the vegetation drag term, which is found to scale identically) in the boundary layer is $\delta^{-4} \sim (\Rey \Ndg)^{4/3}$. The terms balance when $\Rey \sim {\Ndg}^{1/2}$ (or $\Rey \sim H/\delta$), explaining the numerically observed asymptote (see figure \ref{Re_vs_delta}). This analysis predicts that the mode structure is self-similar over the length scale $\delta$; the verification of this expectation is shown in figure \ref{Asymptotic_mode}, supporting this argument.

From these asymptotic behaviors, Mode 1 may be interpreted as the instability of the flow in the boundary layer, whereas Mode 2 may be understood as the instability on the scale of the water column. 
Table \ref{tab:comparison} compares the two modes to each other, and to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. 
Mode 1 appears to be closely related to the Kelvin Helmholtz mechanism, whereas Mode 2 arises purely from the interaction between the unvegetated water column and the flow through the vegetation. 
Vegetation drag plays a dominant role in the mechanism for both the modes, which distinguishes our analysis from the traditional Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. 
The appearance of vegetation drag parameter in the dominant balance of \eqref{Orr-somerfield} and the threshold criteria demonstrates its role in setting the threshold.

Similar phenomenon of large amplitude coherent oscillation of terrestrial canopies in atmospheric flow known as \textit{honami}\cite{Inoue56,Raupach96}, have also been observed.
A crucial difference between the atmospheric and aquatic flow is that the atmospheric flows are essentially unbounded vertically\cite{Vivoni98,Nepf00}. 
Another major difference between the two is the considerable difference of stiffness of canopies; terrestrial canopies tend to be much more rigid, whereas aquatic canopies are buoyant\cite{Vivoni98,Ghisal02}. 
Despite these differences, in the framework of our model, the limit of $\hg/H \ll 1$ while $\delta/\hg$ = constant can be used to represents the hydrodynamic instability for the terrestrial case with stiff grass blades. We find that in this case, the transition from Mode 1 to Mode 2 happens at such a large grass density, so as to make Mode 2 irrelevant. We recover the Kelvin-Helmholtz-like characteristics observed in the terrestrial case. 

The deviation of our model predictions from the observed may be attributed to the various simplification we have made in our model. 
In a real canopy, the drag coefficients are known to vary from bottom to tip of the grass blades\cite{Vivoni98,Nepf00}. 
The turbulent viscosity is also known to vary between the flow of unvegetated region and flow through the canopy\cite{Ghisal02}. 
Although an improved analysis of flow with these variation in the model might lead to a better agreement between the observed and the predicted quantities, these variation are not central to the mechanism leading to the instability of flow.

In conclusion, we note that the threshold flow condition observed in the field and in lab experiments arises due to the presence of vegetation drag. 
We show the origin of this threshold using a consistent continuum hydrodynamic stabiity analysis for the shear flow that develops as a result of the drag. 
Such an analysis not only explains quantitative observations, but also provides an understanding of the hydrodynamic instability mechanism. 
The extent of the structure of Mode 2 throughout the depth of the water column implies an efficient transport of suspended tracers compared to that due to the localized structure of Mode 1 near the canopy top. 
Our analysis also informs flow structure formation in many other related scenarios, such as flow over coral reefs, permeable sediments, etc. and therefore is expected to have a wider impact.
