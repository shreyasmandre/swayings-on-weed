\begin{abstract}
%The spontaneous waving of marine grass is thought to be due to a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability resulting from an inflection point in the flow profile. 
%We find that this inflection point is located inside the grass canopy but it does not lead to Kelvin Helmholtz instability which is 
%normally observed in a free shear layer. We also show that the wavelength of coherent vortices scales with the unvegetated water depth, and not with 
%the shear layer thickness as predicted by a theory based on Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. Based on these results, we propose a mechanism for waving 
%marine grass based on the shear instability of the flow above the canopy.

%The spontaneous waving of marine grass is though to be due to a Kelving-helmholtz instability resulting from strong shear near top of grass. On the contrary
%we find that strong velocity shear resulting from vertical discontinuity of drag due to presence of grass does not lead to Kelvin-Helmholtz instability which is 
%normally observed in free shear flows. We also show that wavelength of coherent vortices scales with the unvegetated water depth. Based on these results, 
%we propose an alternative mechanism which attributes waving of marine grass on shear instability of flow above the canopy. 

The spontaneous waving of marine grass is thought to be due to a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability resulting from an inflection point in the flow profile. We find that this inflection point
is located near the tip of grass canopy. Our analysis shows that flow in presence of grass become unstable not only through a mechanism of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability associated with 
inflection point but also through shear instability of flow above grass coupled with the porous flow through grass bed. We further show that in canopy with high submergence ratio
Kelvin-Helmholtz insatbility is damped due to grass drag.

%\section{Introduction}
Sea grasses exhibit rich set of dynamics due to their interaction with the flow of water and can considerably affect surrounding hydrodynamic conditions.
Resulting changes in hydrodynamic conditions can influence number of environmental variables and processes such as transport of sediments, contaminants, dissolved oxygen, plant growth, and biomass production, etc \cite{Fonseca87,Nepf99,Nepf2012}. 
Flexible grass canopies respond to steady currents in the form of coherent large amplitude oscillations, known as mo-nami \cite{AckermanOkubo93}. Such motion is considered to play a central role in the recruitment of microscopic marine organisms, such as blue mussel larvae\cite{Grizzle96}.
The hydrodynamic mechanism underlying monami is the focus of this paper. 

Similar phenomenon of large amplitude coherent oscillation of canopy in atmospheric flow known as ho-nami\cite{Inoue56,Raupach96}, have also been observed.
A crucial difference between the atmospheric and aquatic flow is that the atmospheric flows are essentially unbounded vertically\cite{Vivoni98,Nepf00}. 
Another major difference between the two is the considerable difference of stiffness of canopies; terrestrial canopies tend to be much more rigid, whereas aquatic canopies are buoyant\cite{Vivoni98,Ghisal02}.
Due to these differences between aquatic and marine flow, our analysis of flow in presence of vegetation in a bounded domain is applicable only to marine canopies. 

Existing explanation of monami invokes the existence of strong shear near the top of the canopy \cite{Ghisal02,Raupach96} due to different amounts of drag experienced by fluid in and above the canopy. 
This shear layer is assumed to become unstable to coherent vortices through a mechanism similar to Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. 
Influence of these coherent eddies over sea grasses is manifested in their large amplitude synchronous oscillations.

\begin{figure}

\caption{Steady flow profile from the experiment of Ghisalberti\cite{Nepf04} (Case-I from Table-1 with 1250 plants/$m^2$, 
plant height = 13.7$\pm .2$cm and blade width of 0.64 cm)
 and it's approximation with $U_0=7.28$ cm/s and $\delta = 5.02cm$ with our model. The canopy extends upto $y=h_g$ in the water column of depth $2H$. 
The steady velocity profile can be decomposed into three regions, (i) A parabolic profile in the unvegetated region, (ii) a uniform profile deep within the grass bed, and (iii) a boundary layer of thicness $\delta$ near the canopy top. 
The depedence of the boundary layer on the vegetation density $\Ndg$ is shown in the inset.}
\label{basicflow}
\end{figure}

While the shear layer model successfully appears to predict frequency of monami for number of experimental observations, several aspect of existing theory remain unsatisfactory. 
First, while the free shear layer is established due to the vegetation drag, the linear stability analysis\cite{Raupach96} does not take this drag into account, rendering this explanation inconsistent. 
Second, classical free shear flow is known to be unstable for all Reynolds number\cite{drazin}, whereas observations in the lab\cite{Ghisal02} and the field\cite{Grizzle96} indicate the existence of a threshold 
flow speed below which waving is not observed. 
Finally, the thickness of the free shear layer, defined as the momentum thickness of the boundary layer near the grass tip, is in many cases comparable to the unvegetated layer thickness,
and therefore inconsistent with the assumptions of the free shear layer instability. 
These drawbacks of existing theory suggest that flow through vegetation requires further investigation for better understanding of the phenomenon.

In this paper we present a mathematical \shreyas model exhibiting a rich behavior, which is not only consistent within itself, but also with lab experiments and field observations of the phenomenon.
The synchronous waving may be understood to be arising from the linear instability of a uniform flow over the grass bed. 
The threshold condition for the onset of the instability and the resulting waving frequency compares well with experimental observations.
In the limit of a dense grass bed, two distinct unstable modes can be asymptotically distinguished, with one of them sharing many characteristics with the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. 
In the parameter regime typical of marine grass beds, the two modes merge and are indistinguishable.

The drag exerted by the grass bed on the flow is central to the hypothesized mechanism\cite{Ghisal02} of the instability underlying monami because it realizes the shear layer structure of the flow. 
The flexibility of the grass blades, on the other hand, is considered to merely aid in visualizing the flow structure resulting from the instability\cite{Nepf2012}. 
It has been demonstrated that the instability and the resulting flow structures are present even when the grass blades are replaced with rigid dowels\cite{Ghisal02}. 
Therefore, in the interest of deriving the simplest mathematical model for the linear instability, we consider the grass bed to form a rigid structure that exchanges momentum with the surrounding fluid but does not deform. 
Indeed, a more detailed calculation undertaken for terrestrial grass demonstrated\cite{Delangre06} that when the timescale of the instability is well-separated from the period of natural oscillations of the grass bed, 
the flow instability is similar to the instability of a shear layer.

\label{Re_vs_delta}
\end{figure}
We use a mean field model for the coupling between the flow and the canopy. 
Drag force exerted by the grass is approximated via a continuous body force $\mathbf{f}=-N_g\mathbf{f_d}$ in the fluid momentum balance\cite{Vivoni98,Nepf99,Ghisal02,Delangre04,Delangre06} as
\begin{equation}
\rho \left(\bu_{t}+\bu.\grad\bu \right) = -\grad P+\mu\grad^{2}\bu +\mathbf{f}+\rho\mathbf{g}, \quad \grad\cdot\bu = 0,
\label{navier-stokes}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{f_{d}}$ is drag force per unit length of the grass blade, $N_g$ the grass number density per unit area, $\rho$ the fluid density, $\mathbf{u}$ the velocity, 
$P$ the pressure, $\mu$ the turbulent viscosity and $\mathbf{g}$ the acceleration due to gravity. 
The Reynolds number of the flow on the scale of a grass blade is expected to be O($10^2$-$10^3$), and hence the drag force is dominated by form drag, and is modeled as 
$\mathbf{f_{d}}=C_N \rho u_{N}^{2}d\bn + C_{T}\rho u_{T}^{2}d\bt$ \shreyas{citation needed} 
where $d$ is average width of grass blade $C_{N}$ and $C_{T}$ are normal and tangential drag coefficients respectively; $\bu_{T}$, $\bu_{N}$ are velocity vector along and
normal to grass while $\bt,\bn$ being unit vector along and normal to grass. 
We expect $C_T \ll C_N$ and take $C_T=0$ for rest of analysis. 
In the field, both $C_N$ and $N_g$ vary with distance from the bottom but we do not expect these variation to be central to the mechanism and therefore take $C_N$ and $N_g$ to be constants. 
Based on previous experiments\cite{Vivoni98}, we take $C_N \approx 1$.

For consistency of analysis, we calculate the steady flow $\bu = U(y)\boldsymbol{\hat{x}}$ as a solution of \eqref{navier-stokes}, and examine its linear stability. 
Such a steady state flow driven by constant pressure gradient satisfies $-{dP}/{dx}+\mu U''(y) +S(y) \rho C_N d N_gU^2=0$, where $S(y)=1$ in the vegetated layer $0<y<\hg$ and $S(y)=0$ in the unvegetated layer $\hg< y< 2H$.
The flow in the laboratory experiments is better approximated by zero shear at the bottom ($y=0$) and top ($y=2H$) of the fluid layer, as can be seen from the comparison between sample solutions and mean flow observed in laboratory experiment shown in Figure \ref{fig:basicflow}. 
Flow consist of a region within grass of approximately constant velocity $U_g \sim \sqrt{\frac{dP/dx}{\rho C_N dN_g}}$ arising from balance of drag force with pressure gradient and a parabolic velocity profile in unvegetated region due to balance of viscous force and pressure gradient. 
Continuity of flow speed and shear stress at canopy top give rise to a boundary layer in the flow profile near the tip of the grass. 
The boundary layer near the canopy top results from purely local dynamics independent of the influence of the boundaries, and may therefore be identified as a free shear layer\cite{Ghisal02} in the previous explanation of monami. 
In our model, this leads to a shear layer thickness $\delta = (\Rey\Ndg)^{-1/3} H$, where $\Ndg = \left(C_N d H N_g\right)$ is the vegetation frontal area per bed area, $\Rey=\rho U_0 H/\mu$ is the Reynolds number of the flow, and $U_0 = {(dP/dx)~H^2}/{\mu}$ is scale for velocity. 
This dependence of the boundary layer thickness on the grass density $N_g$, shown in Figure \ref{basicflow}, gives us a way to systematically control it and investigate its effect on the instability mechanism.

Considering small perturbations $u, v, p$ about the base profile $U$ and $P$ respectively, equation \eqref{navier-stokes} expanded to linear order in the perturbations yields
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\rho(u_t+U u_x+vU_y) &= -p_x+ {\mu}\nabla^2u-2S\rho C_{N}dN_{g}Uu, \\
\rho(v_t+ Uv_x) &= -p_y+ {\mu}\nabla^2v, \hspace{0.3cm} \nabla\cdot\bu=0.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
These equations can be non-dimensionalized using half channel height $H$, velocity $U_0$, and the associated advection time $H/U_0$. 
We are left with three non-dimensional parameters in the model, viz. $\Rey$, $\Ndg$, and the submergence ratio of the grass $h_g/H$. 
We also use $\delta/H$ in lieu of $\Ndg$ to parametrize the grass density and help elucidate the mechanism of the instability. 
With these scaling, and using a stream function $\psi$ with $u = \psi_{y}, v= -\psi_x$ to satisfy mass balance, we seek a wave solution of the form $\left(u,v,\psi \right)= \left(\hat u, \hat v, \hat\phi \right)e^{ikx+\sigma t}$ to  obtain a modified Orr-Sommerfield equation. 
The eigenvalue $\sigma$ for a given $k$ provides growth rate and frequency associated with a perturbation of wavelength $2\pi/k$ through the solution of
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\left(D^2 -k^{2} \right)^2\phi &= \Rey \left[ \left({\sigma}+ikU\right) \left(D^2-k^2\right) -ikU_{yy}\right]\phi \\
&+D\left(2R \Ndg S U D \phi\right),
\label{Orr-somerfield}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $D=d/dy$, and subject to the boundary conditions $D\phi = D^2\phi = 0$ at $y=0$ and $y=2$. 

A threshold in $\Rey$ for the onset of the instability naturally emerges from the solution of \eqref{Orr-somerfield}. 
The dependence of this critical $\Rey$, and the corresponding fastest growing wavenumber $k$, on the $\delta/H$ and $\hg/H$ is shown in figure \ref{Re_vs_delta}, and compared with experimental observation of the threshold\cite{Ghisal02}. 

Comparison of frequency (Im$(\sigma)$) of the fastest growing mode with that of experimental observations of frequencies in the lab scale experiments, for cases where the vegetation was sufficiently dense to be modeled by a continuum drag field, is also shown in 
Figure \ref{Re_vs_delta}. The observed frequencies are associated with the peaks in velocity spectra, frequency of monami and frequency of vortex passage \cite{Ghisal02}\shreyas{cite someone}. The deviation of predicted frequency from the observed may be attributed to the various 
simplification we have made in our model. In a real canopy, the drag coefficients are known to
vary from bottom to tip of the grass blades\cite{Vivoni98,Nepf00}. The turbulent viscosity is also known to vary between the flow of unvegetated region and flow through the canopy\cite{Ghisal02}. Although these variation
are not central to the mechanism leading to the instability of flow, we believe an improved analysis of flow with these variation in the model might lead to a better agreement between the
observed frequency and the predicted frequency.

To better understand the mechanism of waving, we consider the behavior of the instability, especially the fastest growing wavenumber, as a function of the vegetation drag, especially as it becomes asymptotically large, i.e. $\Ndg \gg 1$ (or $\delta \ll H$).
The fastest growing wavenumber first increases proportional to $H/\delta$, but at a critical grass density discontinuously jumps and remains $O(1)$. 
To aid in explaining the behavior, we show heat maps of Re$(\sigma)$ as a function of $\Rey$ and $k$ \shreyas{Make sure to remone $H$ from $kH$ because $k$ is dimensionless.}, for different $\hg/H$ and $\Ndg$ in figure \ref{K_Re_sigma_set3}. 
The lowest $\Rey$ on the neutral curve sets the threshold. 
We observe that as $\Ndg$ increases, the unstable region splits into two. We refer to the unstable region with the higher $k$ as ``Mode 1'', and the one with the lower $k$ as ``Mode 2''. 
The unstable region for Mode 1, depending on $\hg/H$ either recedes to higher $\Rey$ or shrinks to zero size, as the grass density increases, causing the discontinuity in the most unstable mode.

The distinct asymptotic behavior of the two modes as $\Ndg \gg 1$ allows us to understand the mechanism of the instability. 
Mode 2 has a threshold $\Rey \sim ({\delta}/{H})^{-3/2}$ (or $\Rey \propto \Ndg$) for $k\sim O(1)$, shown in figure \ref{Re_vs_delta}, which can be understood by asymptotic analysis of \eqref{Orr-somerfield}.
Noting that for large $\Ndg$, the non-dimensional steady flow velocity inside the grass is $U_g \sim (\Rey \Ndg)^{-1/2}$. 
Using this estimate, and $\Rey\gg1$, \eqref{Orr-somerfield} within the grass simplifies into $\sigma\left(D^2-k^2\right)\phi = -2{(\Ndg/\Rey)^{1/2}}D^2\phi$ \shreyas{check sign}, while in the unvegetated region it simplifies to the Rayleigh equation $ \left(\sigma+ikU\right) \left(D^2-k^2\right)\phi =  ikU_{yy}\phi$. 
This analysis predicts that the mode shape would converge as $\Rey\gg 1$ and $\Ndg \gg 1$ but $\Rey/\Ndg \sim O(1)$, in agreement with out numerical results shown in figure \ref{Asymptotic_mode}. 


We interpret this as the instability of an inviscid flow, with the vegetation modeled by a continuum drag field, and for which the boundary layer near the grass tip plays no role. The only remaining parameter $\Rey/\Ndg$ sets the threshold, leading to the asymptotic behavior $\Rey \propto \Ndg$ (or $\Rey \sim ({\delta}/{H})^{-3/2}$).


\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[]{Asymptotic_noshear}
\caption{Plot of mode shape $|\phi|$ for different shear layer thickness in limit of small shear layer thickness for representative values of grass density. Mode 1 is shown in solid and Mode 2 is shown in dashed. The parameters Mode 2 shapes are chosen such that $\Rey \gg 1$, $\Ndg \gg 1$ (specifying in terms of $\delta/H$) but $\Rey/\Ndg = O(1)$. The mode shapes approach each other for these small values of $\delta/H$ indicating that the large grass density asymptote is reached. Mode 2 shapes appear self-similar in shape as $\delta\to 0$, and are compared to each other on a rescaled coordinate in the inset. Inset shows $|\phi|$ for Mode 1 as a function of $(y-\hg)/\delta$. The modes approach a universal shape, indicating that an asymptotic limit has been reached. The limit is not yet reached for the case $\delta/H = 0.01$ due to the influence of bottom boundary; the grass height in this case is comparable to the boundary layer thickness.}
\label{Asymptotic_mode}
\end{figure}

On the other hand, Mode 1 asymptotically localizes to the boundary layer near the grass tip, and exhibits a different asymptotic behavior with $k \sim O(H/\delta)$, and $\Rey \sim (H/\delta)$ (or $\Rey \propto {\Ndg}^{1/2}$) at the threshold. 
This limit can be understood through asymptotically estimating the sizes of the terms in \eqref{Orr-somerfield} using $D\sim \delta^{-1}$, $\sigma \sim \delta^{-1}$, and $U\sim \delta$; the magnitude of the advection term is $\Rey/\delta^3 \sim \Rey^2 \Ndg $, and the viscous term (or the vegetation drag term, which has the same magnitude) in the boundary layer is $\delta^{-4} \sim (\Rey \Ndg)^{4/3}$. The terms balance when $\Rey \sim {\Ndg}^{1/2}$ (or $\Rey \sim H/\delta$), explaining the numerically observed asymptote (see figure \ref{Re_vs_delta}. This analysis predicts that the mode structure is self-similar over the length scale $\delta$; the verification of this expectation is shown in figure \ref{Asymptotic_mode}, supporting this argument.

From these asymptotic behaviors, Mode 1 may be interpreted as the instability of the flow in the boundary layer, whereas Mode 2 may be understood as the instability on the scale of the water column. Table \ref{tab:comparison} compares the two modes to each other, and to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. Mode 1 appears to be closely related to the Kelvin Helmholtz mechanism, whereas Mode 2 arises purely from the interaction between the unvegetated water column and the flow through the vegetation.

In conclusion we note that linear stability analysis of flow in presence of canopy reveals two distinct modes of flow instability which might lead to monami. 
The occurrence of these modes for flow instability in a canopy depends on its submergence ratio and shear layer thickness. Our analysis predict a threshold criteria characterized by a Reynolds number. 
The predicted value of threshold Reynolds number agrees well with experimentally observed parameters. 
Inclusion of variation of drag coefficient along the grass filament might lead to better agreement between the observed and predicted frequency of monami. 
Our analysis also informs flow structure formation in many other related scenarios, such as flow over coral reefs, permeable sediments, etc. and therefore is expected to have a wider impact.
