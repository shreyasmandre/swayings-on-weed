\begin{abstract}
The onset of \monami ~-- the synchronous waving of sea grass beds driven by a steady flow -- is modeled as a linear instability of the steady flow. Our model treats the drag exerted by the grass in establishing the steady flow profile, and in damping out perturbations to it. The damping from the vegetation drag leads to a finite threshold flow for the instability. This threshold agrees with experimental observations, and so does the predicted waving frequency. This role of vegetation drag differentiates our mechanism from the previous hypothesis that the Kelvin-Helmholz instability underlies \monami.
\end{abstract}

\maketitle
Sea grasses exhibit a rich set of dynamical behavior due to their collective interaction with both steady and oscillatory flows.  
The resulting changes in hydrodynamic conditions can influence number of environmental processes such as transport of sediments, contaminants, dissolved oxygen, plant growth, and biomass production  \cite{Fonseca87,Grizzle96,Nepf99,Nepf2012}. 
The simplest response of these flexible vegetation canopies to steady currents is the formation of coherent large amplitude oscillations, known as \monami ~\cite{AckermanOkubo93}.  
In this letter we provide a hydrodynamic mechanism for the onset of these coherent oscillations.
\newline
Current explanations of \monami ~invoke the existence of a shear layer due to vegetation drag  \cite{Ghisal02,Raupach96} and its instability through a mechanism similar to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. 
This instability is thought to lead to coherent eddies over the sea grass meadow, which then drive large amplitude synchronous oscillations.
\newline
While the shear layer model appears to predict the frequency of \monami ~consistent with experimental observations, several aspects of existing theory remain unsatisfactory. 
(i) While the free shear layer is established due to the vegetation drag, linear stability analysis \cite{Raupach96,White07} does not account for this, rendering this explanation inconsistent. 
(ii) Classical free shear flow is known to be unstable for all Reynolds numbers \cite{drazin}, whereas observations in the lab \cite{Ghisal02} and the field \cite{Grizzle96} indicate the existence of a threshold flow speed below which \monami ~is not observed. 
(iii) The thickness of the free shear layer, defined as the momentum thickness of the boundary layer near the top of the meadow, is in many cases comparable to the unvegetated layer thickness, and therefore inconsistent with the assumptions of the free shear layer instability.
Here we present a mathematical model for the hydrodynamic linear stability analysis that accounts correctly for these effects, while also explaining lab experiments and field observations.
\newline
The drag exerted by the grass bed on the flow is central to the hypothesized instability for \monami. 
The instability and the resulting flow structures, though manifest in the waving of grasses, also persist if the grass blades are replaced by rigid dowels \cite{Ghisal02}. 
Therefore, for simplicity, we consider the grass bed to exchange momentum with the surrounding fluid but not deform. 
A criteria for the validity of this assumptions is presented at the end of this letter.
% Indeed, a more detailed calculation modeling terrestrial grass demonstrated \cite{Delangre06} that when the timescale of the instability is well-separated from the period of natural oscillations of the grass bed, the flow instability is similar to the instability of a shear layer.

\label{Re_vs_delta}
\end{figure}
We use a mean field model for the coupling between the flow and the vegetation. 
The force exerted by the vegetation is approximated via a continuous body force $\mathbf{f}=-N_g\mathbf{f_d}$,  
where $\mathbf{f_{d}}$ is drag force per unit length of the grass blade, and $N_g$ the grass blade number density per unit area \cite{Vivoni98,Nepf99,Ghisal02,Delangre04,Delangre06}. 
In the vegetation, the equations of continuity and momentum balance can be written as 
\begin{equation}
\quad \grad\cdot\bu = 0,\hspace{3mm} \rho \left(\bu_{t}+\bu.\grad\bu \right) = -\grad p+\mu\grad^{2}\bu +\mathbf{f}+\rho\mathbf{g}
\label{navier-stokes}
\end{equation}
where $\rho$ is the fluid density, $\mathbf{u}$ the velocity, 
$p$ the pressure, $\mu$ the eddy viscosity (the flow is turbulent) and $\mathbf{g}$ the acceleration due to gravity. 
The Reynolds number of the flow based on the scale of the grass blade is expected to be $O(10^2-10^3)$, implying that the form drag on the vegetation dominates over the skin-friction. Hence we model it as 
$\mathbf{f_{d}}=C_N \rho u_{N}^{2}d\bn$, 
where $d$ is average width of grass blade projected in the flow direction, $C_{N}$ the drag coefficient, $u_{N}$ and $\bn$ are the velocity component and unit vector normal to the grass. 
In the field, both $C_N$ and $N_g$ vary with distance from the bottom but we do not expect these variations to be central to the instability mechanism and therefore take $C_N$ and $N_g$ to be constants. 
Based on previous experiments \cite{Vivoni98}, we take $C_N \approx 1$.

As $\Ndg \propto N_g$ increases, the unstable region splits into two labeled as ``Mode 1'' and ``Mode 2''. 
For $\Ndg$ below a critical value, the Mode 1 sets the threshold $\Rey$ whereas above the critical $\Ndg$ onset is determined by Mode 2.}
\label{K_Re_sigma_set3}
\end{figure*}
To understand the onset of \monami, we first calculate the steady flow $\bu = U(y)\boldsymbol{\hat{x}}$ as a solution of eq.~\eqref{navier-stokes}, and examine its linear stability. 
Such a steady state flow driven by constant pressure gradient $dP/dx$ satisfies 
\begin{equation}
 -\frac{dP}{dx}+\mu U''(y) +S(y) \rho C_N d N_gU^2=0
\label{base_equ}
\end{equation}
where $S(y)=1$ in the vegetated layer $0<y<\hg$ and $S(y)=0$ in the unvegetated layer $\hg< y< 2H$. 
In the limit of large vegetation density, shear stress exerted by the bottom surface is expected to be negligible compared to the vegetation drag, and hence the bottom surface ($y=0$) is approximated by zero shear.   
A comparison of the steady flow profile from the solution of eq.~\eqref{base_equ} with experimental measurements is shown in fig.~\ref{basicflow}.
Flow within vegetation has approximately constant velocity $U_g \sim \sqrt{\frac{dP/dx}{\rho C_N dN_g}}$ arising from the balance between drag and pressure gradient, and the flow outside has a simple parabolic velocity profile due to the balance between viscous forces and the pressure gradient. 
Continuity of flow speed and shear stresses at the top of the meadow gives rise to a boundary layer.
In our model the balance between viscous forces and the drag force in the shear layer $(\mu u_\text{sl}/\delta^2 \sim \rho C_N d N_g u_\text{sl}^2)$ and the continuity of shear stress across the top of the vegetation $(u_\text{sl}/\delta \sim U_0/H)$, leads to a shear layer thickness $\delta=(\Rey\tilde{N_g})^{-1/3}H$, where $\Ndg = \left(C_N d H N_g\right)$ is the vegetation frontal area per bed area, $\Rey=\rho U_0 H/\mu$ is the Reynolds number of the flow, $u_{sl}$ is the velocity scale in shear layer and $U_0 = {(dP/dx)~H^2}/{\mu}$ is the velocity scale in the unvegetated region. 
This boundary layer results from purely local dynamics, independent of the influence of the boundaries, and we identify it as a free shear layer \cite{Ghisal02} in the previous explanation of \monami. 
The dependence of the boundary layer thickness on the vegetation density $N_g$, shown in fig.~\ref{basicflow}, gives us a way to systematically investigate its effect on the instability mechanism.
The asymptotic regime of a thin boundary layer is expected to hold for $\Rey \Ndg \gtrsim 100$; minor departures from this scaling can be seen in the inset of fig.~\ref{basicflow}.
\newline
To understand the evolution of small perturbations to the steady flow profile, we substitute $\bu = (U+\tilde{u}, \tilde{v})$, $p=P+\tilde{p}$ in eq.~\eqref{navier-stokes} and expand to linear order to obtain (after dropping the tilde decoration)
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\rho(u_t+U u_x+vU_y) &= -p_x+ {\mu}\nabla^2u-2S\rho C_{N}dN_{g}Uu, \\
\rho(v_t+ Uv_x) &= -p_y+ {\mu}\nabla^2v, \hspace{0.3cm} \nabla\cdot\bu=0.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
These equations can be non-dimensionalized using half channel height $H$, velocity $U_0$, and the associated advection time $H/U_0$. 
We have three non-dimensional parameters in the model, ie. $\Rey$, $\Ndg$, and the submergence ratio of the vegetation $h_g/H$. 
We also use $\delta/H$ in lieu of $\Ndg$ to parametrize the vegetation density and help elucidate the mechanism of the instability. 
With these scalings, and using a stream function $\psi$ with $u = \psi_{y}, v= -\psi_x$ to satisfy mass balance, we seek a wave solution of 
the form $\left(u,v,\psi \right)= \left(\hat u(y), \hat v(y), \hat\phi(y) \right)e^{ikx+\sigma t}$ to  obtain a modified Orr-Sommerfield equation. 
The growth rate $\sigma$ for a given wave number $k=2\pi /\lambda$ satisfies the eigenvalue problem
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\left(D^2 -k^{2} \right)^2\phi &= \Rey \left[ \left({\sigma}+ikU\right) \left(D^2-k^2\right) -ikU_{yy}\right]\phi \\
&+D\left(2R \Ndg S U D \phi\right),
\label{Orr-somerfield}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $D=d/dy$, and subject to the boundary conditions $D\phi = D^2\phi = 0$ at $y=0$ and $y=2$.

We solve this eigenvalue problem and a threshold in $\Rey$ of $O(100)$, above which the flow is unstable (Re$(\sigma)>0$), emerges from the 
solution of eq.~\eqref{Orr-somerfield}. The dependence of this critical $\Rey$, and the corresponding fastest growing wavenumber $k$, on $\delta/H$ and $\hg/H$ is shown 
in fig.~\ref{Re_vs_delta}, and is found to compare well with experimental observations \cite{Ghisal02}.
The threshold Reynolds number increases with the vegetation density, indicating a competition between the 
destabilizing shear in the flow, and the stabilizing effect of damping due to vegetation drag.
A similar conclusion was presented \cite{White07} in the case flow around emergent (i.e., $\hg>2H$) sea grass patch, but by assuming $U(y)$ to be a tanh-profile \textit{ad hoc}, and neglecting the viscous term.
Linear stability calculations for terrestrial grass do not exhibit a threshold flow condition 
either due to the exclusion of the vegetation drag in their model \cite{Raupach96}, or because of the \textit{ad hoc}
assumptions about the mean velocity profile \cite{Raupach96,Delangre06}. 

Comparison of frequency (Im$(\sigma)$) of the fastest growing mode with that of experimental observations of frequencies in
the lab scale experiments, for cases where the vegetation was sufficiently dense to be modeled by a continuum drag field, is also shown in the inset in fig.~\ref{Re_vs_delta}b. 
The observed frequencies are associated with the peaks in velocity spectra, frequency of \monami ~and frequency of 
vortex passage \cite{Ghisal02}, and compare well with the predicted frequencies.

 \label{tab:comparison}
\end{table*}
To better understand the mechanism of waving and the origin of the threshold, we consider the behavior of the instability as a function of the vegetation drag characterized by $\Ndg$.
The fastest growing wavenumber first increases proportional to $H/\delta$, but at a critical vegetation density discontinuously jumps and remains $O(1)$ (see fig.~\ref{Re_vs_delta}). 
To aid in explaining the behavior, we show heat maps of Re$(\sigma)$ as a function of $\Rey$ and $k$, for different $\hg/H$ and $\Ndg$ in fig.~\ref{K_Re_sigma_set3}. 
The lowest $\Rey$ on the neutral curve sets the threshold. 
We observe that as $\Ndg$ increases, the unstable region splits into two. We refer to the unstable region with the higher $k$ as ``Mode 1'', and the one with the lower $k$ as ``Mode 2''. 
The unstable region for Mode 1, depending on $\hg/H$ either recedes to higher $\Rey$ or shrinks to zero size, as the vegetation density increases, causing the most unstable mode to transition discontinuously.

The distinct asymptotic behavior of the two modes as $\Ndg \gg 1$ allows us to understand the mechanism of the instability. 
Mode 1 asymptotically localizes to the boundary layer near the top of the vegetation, and exhibits an asymptotic behavior with $k \sim O(H/\delta)$, and $\Rey \sim (H/\delta)$ (or $\Rey \propto {\Ndg}^{1/2}$) at the threshold. 
This limit can be understood through asymptotically estimating the sizes of the terms in eq.~\eqref{Orr-somerfield} using $D\sim \delta^{-1}$, $\sigma \sim \delta^{-1}$, and $U\sim \delta$; the magnitude of the advection term is $\Rey/\delta^3 \sim \Rey^2 \Ndg $, and the viscous term (or the vegetation drag term, which is found to scale identically) in the boundary layer is $\delta^{-4} \sim (\Rey \Ndg)^{4/3}$. 
The terms balance when $\Rey \sim H/\delta$ (or $\Rey \sim {\Ndg}^{1/2}$) leading to a simplification of eq.~\eqref{Orr-somerfield} as
\begin{align}
(D^2-k^2)^2 \phi- 2 \Rey \Ndg D( SUD\phi) = \sigma \Rey (D^2-k^2)\phi,
\label{eqn:mode1asymp}
\end{align} 
in a region of thickness O($\delta$) near $y=\hg$.
Since the relative magnitude of the terms on the r.h.s. to those on the l.h.s. of this equation is $\Rey/\Ndg^{1/2}$, we expect identical asymptotic behavior for fixed $\Rey/\Ndg^{1/2}$. Therefore the threshold obtained for Mode 1 is $\Rey \propto \Ndg^{1/2}$ (or $\Rey \propto H/\delta$) explaining the numerically observed asymptote (see fig.~\ref{Re_vs_delta}). 
This analysis also concludes that the mode structure is self-similar over the length scale $\delta$ for fixed $\Rey/\Ndg^{1/2}$; the verification of this expectation is shown in fig.~\ref{Asymptotic_mode}, supporting this argument.

On the other hand, the threshold condition for Mode 2 is numerically observed to be $\Rey \propto ({\delta}/{H})^{-3/2}$ (or $\Rey \propto \Ndg$) for $k\sim O(1)$, shown in fig.~\ref{Re_vs_delta}, which can be understood by an asymptotic scaling analysis of eq.~\eqref{Orr-somerfield} by assuming $\Rey \gg 1$ but fixed $\Rey/\Ndg \sim O(1)$.
Note that for large $\Ndg$, the non-dimensional steady flow velocity inside the vegetation is $U_g \sim (\Rey \Ndg)^{-1/2}$. 
This estimate simplifies eq.~\eqref{Orr-somerfield} to 
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
\sigma\left(D^2-k^2\right)\phi = -2{(\Ndg/\Rey)^{1/2}}D^2\phi,  \quad &\text{ for $y<\hg$}  \\
\left(\sigma+ikU\right) \left(D^2-k^2\right)\phi =  ikU_{yy}\phi, \quad &\text{ for $y>\hg$}.
\end{split}
\label{eqn:mode2asymp}
\end{align}
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[]{Asymptotic_noshear}
\caption{Plot of mode shape $|\phi|$ for different shear layer thickness in limit of small shear layer thickness for representative values of vegetation density. 
Mode 1 is shown in solid and Mode 2 is shown in dashed. The parameters Mode 2 shapes are chosen such that $\Rey \gg 1$, $\Ndg \gg 1$ (specified in terms of $\delta/H$) but $\Rey/\Ndg = O(1)$. 
The mode shapes approach each other for these small values of $\delta/H$ indicating that the large vegetation density asymptote is reached. Mode 1 shapes appear self-similar in shape as $\delta\to 0$, 
and are compared to each other on a rescaled coordinate in the inset. 
Inset shows $|\phi|$ for Mode 1 as a function of $(y-\hg)/\delta$. The modes approach a universal shape, indicating that an asymptotic limit has been reached. 
The limit is not yet reached for the case $\delta/H = 0.005$ due to the influence of bottom boundary; the vegetation height in this case is comparable to the boundary layer thickness.}
\label{Asymptotic_mode}
\end{figure}
Since $\Rey/\Ndg$ is the only remaining parameter, the mode shape would converge in the aforementioned limit, in agreement with our numerical results for Mode 2 shown in fig.~\ref{Asymptotic_mode}. 
We interpret Mode 2 as the instability of an inviscid flow, with the vegetation modeled by a continuum drag field, and for which the boundary layer near the top of the vegetation plays no role. The only remaining parameter $\Rey/\Ndg$ 
sets the threshold, leading to the asymptotic behavior $\Rey \propto \Ndg$ (or $\Rey \sim ({\delta}/{H})^{-3/2}$).
%On the other hand, Mode 1 asymptotically localizes to the boundary layer near the grass tip, and exhibits a different asymptotic behavior with $k \sim O(H/\delta)$, and $\Rey \sim (H/\delta)$ (or $\Rey \propto {\Ndg}^{1/2}$) at the threshold. 

Table \ref{tab:comparison} compares the two modes to each other, and to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. 
Because Mode 1 eigenfunction is localized over a length scale $\delta$, it may be interpreted as the instability of the flow in the boundary layer, whereas Mode 2 may be understood as the instability on the scale of the water column. 
Mode 1 appears to be closely related to the Kelvin Helmholtz mechanism, whereas Mode 2 arises purely from the interaction between the unvegetated water column and the flow through the vegetation. 
Vegetation drag plays a dominant role in the mechanism for both the modes, which distinguishes our analysis from the traditional Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. 
The appearance of vegetation drag parameter in the dominant balances represented by eq.~\eqref{eqn:mode1asymp} and eq.~\eqref{eqn:mode2asymp}, and the resulting threshold criteria demonstrates its role in setting the threshold.
\newline
Similar phenomenon of large amplitude coherent oscillation of terrestrial canopies in atmospheric flow known as \textit{honami} \cite{Inoue56,Raupach96}, have also been observed.
A crucial difference between the atmospheric and aquatic flow is that the atmospheric flows are essentially unbounded vertically \cite{Vivoni98,Nepf00}. 
Another major difference between the two is the considerable difference of stiffness; terrestrial vegetation tend to be much more rigid, whereas aquatic vegetation is buoyant \cite{Vivoni98,Ghisal02}. 
Despite these differences, in the framework of our model, the limit of $\hg/H \ll 1$ while $\delta/\hg$ = constant can be used to represent the hydrodynamic instability for the terrestrial case with stiff grass blades. We find that in this case, the transition from Mode 1 to Mode 2 happens at such a large vegetation density, so as to make Mode 2 irrelevant. In this manner, we recover the Kelvin-Helmholtz-like characteristics observed in the terrestrial case. 
\newline
The deviation of our model predictions from the observed may be attributed to the various simplifications we have made in our model. 
We have neglected the motion of the grass blades in this analysis, assuming that a small deviation from its equilibrium position generates sufficient restoring force of buoyancy to balance the fluid drag. 
This consideration can be cast using scaling analysis into a simple criteria that the buoyancy time scale $\sqrt{\rho H/\Delta \rho g}$, where $\Delta \rho$ is the difference in densities between the vegetation and the water and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, be much faster than the hydrodynamic time scale $H/U_0$.
The former can be estimated using representative parameter values $\Delta \rho /\rho \approx 0.1$ and $H=1$ m to be about 1 s, and the latter assuming $U_0 \approx 0.1$ m/s to be about 10 s, which is about one order of magnitude slower.
Based on this separation of time scales, role of vegetation deformation appears negligible, or at least not central to the hydrodynamic instability mechanism. 
We have, however, neither accounted for the pre-factors appearing in the scaling argument, nor have we considered cases when the time-scale separation is not so evident.
Indeed, the case where these time-scales are comparable can lead to interesting behavior\cite{Delangre06}, and motivates further investigation. 

In a real meadow, the drag coefficients are known to vary from bottom to tip of the grass blades \cite{Vivoni98,Nepf00}. 
The eddy viscosity is also known to vary between the flow of unvegetated region and flow through the meadow \cite{Ghisal02}. 
Although an improved analysis of flow with these variation in the model might lead to a better agreement between the observed and the predicted quantities, these variation are not central to the mechanism leading to the instability of flow.
\newline\newline
In conclusion, we note that the threshold flow condition observed in the field and in lab experiments arises due to the presence of vegetation drag. 
We show the origin of this threshold using a consistent continuum hydrodynamic stability analysis for the shear flow that develops as a result of the vegetation-induced drag. 
Such an analysis not only explains quantitative observations, but also provides an understanding of the hydrodynamic instability mechanism. 
The extent of the structure of Mode 2 throughout the depth of the water column implies an efficient transport of suspended tracers compared to that due to the localized structure of Mode 1 near the top of the meadow. 
Our analysis also informs flow structure formation in many other related scenarios, such as flow over coral reefs, permeable sediments, etc. and therefore is expected to have a wider impact.
