\begin{abstract}
The spontaneous waving of marine grass is thought to be due to a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability resulting from an inflection point in the flow profile. 
We find that this inflection point is located inside the grass canopy, and the drag from the grass blades damps out the Kelvin Helmholtz instability, 
normally observed in a free shear layer. We also show that the wavelength of coherent vortices scales with the unvegetated water depth, and not with 
the shear layer thickness as predicted by a theory based on Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. Based on these results, we propose a mechanism for waving 
marine grass based on the shear instability of the flow above the canopy.

\section{Introduction}
Rich set of dynamics are exhibited by sea grasses due to their interaction with water flow which can considerably affect the hydrodynamic conditions near the 
grass. Resulting change in hydrodynamic conditions relative to unobstructed flow can influence number of environmental 
variables and processes such as transport of sediments, contaminants, dissolved oxygen;
plant growth and biomass production (known as thigmomorphogenesis) etc. 
%Driven by such applications number of scientific work regarding flow over canopies has been done over 
%last three decades. One of main development is recognition that major contribution to canopy turbulence arises from coherent eddies
%of canopy scales.\newline
Among many dynamics shown by flexible grasses due to their interaction with water flow, their response to steady current in form of large amplitude coherent oscillations known as
mo-nami (Ackerman and Okubo 1993) is focus of this paper. Similar phenomenon of large amplitude coherent oscillation of terrestrial canopy in wind have also been observed named as Honami 
(Inoue 1993).
% Experimental observations (Grizzle 1996) have shown that monami is observed when mean flow speed exceed a certain threshold value. 
\newline
A key feature of flow through submerged vegetation is the existence of strong shear near top of canopy due to
different amount of drag experienced by fluid in and above the canopy, existence of strong shear is manifested by
existence of an inflection point in mean velocity near top of canopy. In addition pattern of coherent eddies propagating downstream 
along have also been observed.
%A crucial feature of a velocity inflection is that it induces a hydrodynamic instability
%process which sets the pattern of coherent eddies propagating over terrestrial and submerged canopies. In response to coherent eddies canopies
%may exhibit synchronous large-amplitude waving (termed as monami in aquatic setting by Ackerman and Okubo[1993], and honami by Inoue (1955) in terrestrial setting). 
%Monami (Honami) can be observed when flow velocity is above certain threshold value, which can depends on flow depth, elasticity of canopy material
%etc.
\newline
Inspired by work of Raupach (1996) for the case of terrestrial grass, previous studies (Ghisalberti 2002) of monami 
have been done under assumption that the a pattern of coherent eddies are excited by hydrodynamic instability of shear layer
similar to that of free shear flow and response of sea grasses to these coherent eddies are exhibited in form of large amplitude oscillations knows as mo-nami.
Several aspect of existing theory remain unclear. The proposed hydrodynamic instability of shear layer layer does not take into account presence of grass whereas shear layer 
was produced due to drag caused by presence vegetation. Since shear layer instability mechanism does not predict any threshold for monami, hence it fails to explain
observations where monami is observed when mean flow speed is above certain value. While atmospheric flow through terrestrial vegetation seems similar to aquatic flow through marine grass, 
atmospheric flow is unbounded in vertical direction.
% but aquatic flow is not so its not obvious that similar mechanism will hold in aquatic case too (2) The proposed hydrodynamic instability mechanism of shear layer produced 
%by presence of grass does not take into account the presence of grass itself (3) It does not predict any threshold condition for waving to happen 
\newline     
In this paper we propose a coupled fluid-canopy model to study dynamics of flexible canopy and flow field. Canopies are represented by a continuous 
medium which is coupled to flow field via a drag term. We did linear stability analysis of flow without ignoring presence of grass via solving 
a generalized orr-sommerfield equation with presence of grass. Our calculation predicts threshold a threshold criteria for waving which is characterized by Reynolds number.
We further show that for flexible marine grass monami is caused by instability of flow above the grass rather than by shear layer. We confirm our analysis by comparing 
prediction from theory with existing data

\section{The model}
We propose a fully coupled model in order to comprehend dynamics of canopy and fluid flow, drag force excerted by grasses is
taken as an additional body force in momentum equation of fluid. We approximate presence of grass via continuous field whose shape at any location is approximated as averaged 
shape of grass at that location which can be obtained by assuming grass to be in quasi-equilibrium at any moment.
% and solving force balance and momentum balance for grass  
\begin{equation}
\rho \left(\bu_{t}+\bu.\grad\bu \right) = -\grad P+\mu\grad^{2}\bu +\mathbf{f}+\rho\mathbf{g}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
 \mathbf{f}=-N\mathbf{f_{d}}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{f}$ is local average drag force per unit volume; $\mathbf{f_{d}}$ is drag force per unit length of grass; N is grass number density. 
Drag force exerted by fluid on grass depends on fluid density $\rho$, flow velocity $\bu$, orientation and diameter of grass which we model as 
\begin{equation}
 \mathbf{f_{d}}=C_{N}\rho\bu_{N}^{2}d\hat{n}+C_{T}\rho\bu_{T}^{2}d\hat{t}
\end{equation}


%\begin{equation}
%\begin{split}
% \frac{\del}{\del s}\left(T\hat{t}+N\hat{n}\right) & +\mathbf{f_{d}}+\mathbf{f_{buoy}} = 0\\
% \frac{\del M}{\del s}&-N = 0\\
% M &= B\kappa
%\end{split}

%\end{equation}
where $C_{N}$ and $C_{T}$ are normal and tangential drag coefficients respectively; $\bu_{T}$, $\bu_{N}$ are velocity vector along and normal to grass.

%For flexible grass whose bending stiffness is really low, we assume that monami/honami is response to oscillations in flow velocity of fluid. In that case we can safely ignore
%set of equation(3).
\section{Stability Analysis}
In order to understand frequency and wavelength associated with passage of dominant eddies over grass which are manifestation of instability of mean flow, 
we investigate stability of base flow profile which can be obtained by solving steady state solution of equation(1). We consider small perturbations $u, v, p$  associated 
with base profile $U$ and $P$ respectively. Momentum and mass balance equation expanded in 1st order of perturbed variable yields.
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
 \frac{\del u}{\del t}+U\frac{\del u}{\del x}+v\frac{\del U}{\del y} &= -\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\del p}{\del x}+\frac{\mu}{\rho}(u_{xx}+u_{yy})-2C_{N}dN_{g}Uu\\
 \frac{\del v}{\del  t}+ U\frac{\del v}{\del x} &= -\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\del p}{\del y}+\frac{\mu}{\rho}(v_{xx}+v_{yy})\\
 \nabla\cdot \bu &= 0
\end{split}
\end{equation}
%In most of recent work on honami/monami base profile have been approximated to a plane mixing layer profile having inflection point near top of canopy, It is also argued that 
%It is instability associated with inflection of mean velocity which is responsible for coherent eddies traveling on top of canopies. In our calculation we get base velocity
%profile by hydrodynamic balance between pressure, drag and diffusive force which also results in a velocity profile with inflection point near top of canopy with additional property 
%of having been produced through equation of motion itself.\newline
We performed stability analysis on two different kind of base flow namely (1) flow driven by constant pressure gradient between two parallel plate (2) constant pressure gradient driven 
flow with zero shear at top. We use following scaling to non-dimensionlize equation of motion
   \[ u = U_{0}\bar{u},\hspace{1cm} y = (H/2)\bar{y}, \hspace{1cm} \text{with}\hspace{2mm} U_{0}=\frac{c_{1}H^2}{4\mu} \]
where $c_{1}$ is constant pressure gradient, H is height at which fluid is present. With these scaling and using stream function $\psi$ with $u = \psi_{y}, v= -\psi_x$, equations 
can be simplified into a single equation.
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
 R_{e}\left[\psi_{yyt}+\psi_{xxt}+U\left(\psi_{xyy}+\psi_{xxx}\right)-U_{yy}\psi_{x} \right] &=\left[\psi_{yyxx}+\psi_{yyyy}+\psi_{xxxx}+\psi_{xxyy} \right]\\
& + 2D_{drag}U\psi_{y}\delta(y-h)\\
& - 2D_{drag}U_{y}\psi_{y} -2D_{drag}U\psi_{yy}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $R_{e}= \frac{\rho U_0 H}{2\mu}$ is Reynolds number and $\bar{N_g} = C_N d N_g H/2$ is non-dimensional grass number density and  $D_{drag} = R_{e}\bar{N_{g}}$ is non-dimensional drag
which is zero outside the grass. Seeking wave solution in form $\left(u,v,\psi \right)= \left(\hat u, \hat v, \hat\phi \right)e^{ikx+\sigma}$, we get generalized orr-sommerfield equation 
which is an eigenvalue problem whose solution provides frequency and wavelength of eddies traveling over canopy.
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\sigma \left(D^2-k^2\phi \right) &= \frac{1}{R_{e}}\left[D^4\phi -2k^{2}D^2\phi +k^{4}\phi \right]\\
				  & +ikU_{yy}\phi-ikU\left(D^2\phi-k^2\phi \right)\\
 & -\frac{2D_{drag}}{R_{e}}U_{y}\phi_{y}-\frac{2D_{drag}}{R_{e}}U\phi_{yy}+\frac{2D_{drag}}{R_{e}}U\phi_{y}\delta(y-h)
\end{split}
\end{equation}
critical Reynolds number above which we get growing solution of perturbation, as a function of grass number density for different grass height shows following characteristics
